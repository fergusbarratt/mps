@article{Hickey2013,
abstract = {The dynamical behaviour of many-body systems is often richer than what can be anticipated from their static properties. Here we show that in closed quantum systems this becomes evident by considering time-integrated observables as order parameters. In particular, the analytic properties of their generating functions, as estimated by full-counting statistics, allow to identify dynamical phases, i.e. phases with specific fluctuation properties of time-integrated observables, and to locate the transitions between these phases. We discuss in detail the case of the quantum Ising chain in a transverse field. We show that this model displays a continuum of quantum dynamical transitions, of which the static transition is just an end point. These singularities are not a consequence of particular choices of initial conditions or other external non-equilibrium protocols such as quenches in coupling constants. They can be probed generically through quantum jump statistics of an associated open problem, and for the case of the quantum Ising chain we outline a possible experimental realisation of this scheme by digital quantum simulation with cold ions.},

abstract = {In this Rapid Communication we discuss how red-sideband cooling is modified in the single-photon strong- coupling regime of cavity optomechanicswhere the radiation pressure of a single photon displaces themechanical oscillator by more than its zero-point uncertainty. Using Fermi's golden rule we calculate the transition rates induced by the optical drive without linearizing the optomechanical interaction. In the resolved-sideband limit we find multiple-phonon cooling resonances for strong single-photon coupling that lead to nonthermal steady states including the possibility of phonon antibunching. Our study generalizes the standard linear cooling theory.},

The method relies on the existence of a conserved number of excitation in the Hamiltonian part and that none of the Lindblad operators describe an excitation of the system. In the absence of dephasing Lindblad operators, the eigensystem of the Liouville operator can be constructed from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian used in the quantum jump approach. Open versions of spin chains, the Tavis-Cummings model and coupled Harmonic oscillators without gain can be solved using this technique.},

	Abstract = {Quantum annealing (QA) has been proposed as a quantum enhanced optimization heuristic exploiting tunneling. Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables, this results in a time-to-99{\%}-success-probability that is {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}8{\$} times faster than SA running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA: D-Wave 2X again runs up to {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}8{\$} times faster than an optimized implementation of QMC on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that QMC, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate QA, scale better than SA. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.},

To classically simulate the time evolution of the system with a limited amount of entanglement, we represent the quantum state using matrix-product states and projected entangled-pair states. We show that the probability of finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass on either a planar or non-planar two-dimensional graph increases rapidly as the amount of entanglement in the state is increased. Furthermore, we propose evolution in complex time as a way to improve simulated adiabatic evolution and mimic the effects of thermal cooling of the quantum annealer.},

	Abstract = {The dynamical behaviour of many-body systems is often richer than what can be anticipated from their static properties. Here we show that in closed quantum systems this becomes evident by considering time-integrated observables as order parameters. In particular, the analytic properties of their generating functions, as estimated by full-counting statistics, allow to identify dynamical phases, i.e. phases with specific fluctuation properties of time-integrated observables, and to locate the transitions between these phases. We discuss in detail the case of the quantum Ising chain in a transverse field. We show that this model displays a continuum of quantum dynamical transitions, of which the static transition is just an end point. These singularities are not a consequence of particular choices of initial conditions or other external non-equilibrium protocols such as quenches in coupling constants. They can be probed generically through quantum jump statistics of an associated open problem, and for the case of the quantum Ising chain we outline a possible experimental realisation of this scheme by digital quantum simulation with cold ions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate in detail the behavior of the bipartite fluctuations of particle number {\$}\backslashhat{\{}N{\}}{\$} and spin {\$}\backslashhat{\{}S{\}}{\^{}}z{\$} in many-body quantum systems, focusing on systems where such U(1) charges are both conserved and fluctuate within subsystems due to exchange of charges between subsystems. We propose that the bipartite fluctuations are an effective tool for studying many-body physics, particularly its entanglement properties, in the same way that noise and Full Counting Statistics have been used in mesoscopic transport and cold atomic gases. For systems that can be mapped to a problem of non-interacting fermions we show that the fluctuations and higher-order cumulants fully encode the information needed to determine the entanglement entropy as well as the full entanglement spectrum through the R$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nyi entropies. In this connection we derive a simple formula that explicitly relates the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix to the R$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nyi entropies of integer order for any finite density matrix. In other systems, particularly in one dimension, the fluctuations are in many ways similar but not equivalent to the entanglement entropy. Fluctuations are tractable analytically, computable numerically in both density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and in principle accessible in condensed matter and cold atom experiments. In the context of quantum point contacts, measurement of the second charge cumulant showing a logarithmic dependence on time would constitute a strong indication of many-body entanglement.},

This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

	Abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.
